# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) - Prototype

## Overview
The **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** is a web-based application developed in **ASP.NET Core MVC**.  
It is designed to streamline the process of **submitting and approving monthly claims** for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers.

This repository contains the **prototype version (Part 1 of PoE)**, which focuses only on the **front-end layout** without back-end functionality.

---

## Features (Prototype)
- **Submit Claim**: Lecturers can enter hours worked and hourly rate.
- **Verify & Approve Claims**: Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers can access claims for review.
- **Upload Supporting Documents**: Lecturers can upload relevant documents (PDF, Word, Excel, images).
- **Track Claim Status**: Lecturers can check the status of submitted claims.

> ⚠️ Note: At this stage, all features are **non-functional placeholders** (prototype only). Actual functionality will be implemented in the next parts of the POE.
